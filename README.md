# cpp_pong

building pong in c++ to learn sfml.

i've sketched in the basic major components of the game, the paddles and game ball and their data and gotten them drawn to the window. i'm looking at this 
as a sort of code kata since i've already built pong in java and the structure of the game and the various problems to be solved are already familiar.
i've spent most of my time researching various aspects of c++; the transition from java is not as smooth as i imagined. i've dabbled with the language before 
but now that i'm actually digging into it and  using the OOP aspects of it is clear how different of a world it is. cpp is so powerful and has so many features it 
can be a bit *overwhelming*. i'm attempting to get my head around the core functionality i need and simply learn to wield those features properly. sfml seems 
straight-forward so far, though it is a challenge to change my thinking from the structure of java's gui apis.
